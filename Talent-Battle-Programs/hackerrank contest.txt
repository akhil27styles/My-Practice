Leaderboard
Given an N numbers array. Rotate the elements of the array in the direction specified by the user(Left or right). If rotation index is Negative, rotate Left otherwise rotate Right

Input Format

Input will contain 2 lines.
First line contains the 2 integers specifying number of elements and the rotation index.
Second line contains space separated elements of the array.

Constraints

N >= 1

Output Format

Space separated elements of the array

Sample Input 0

7 -2        
1 2 3 4 5 6 7
Sample Output 0

3 4 5 6 7 1 2
